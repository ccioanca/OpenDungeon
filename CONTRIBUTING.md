## On Rules Contributing:
- Community driven development & ideation with veto powers from the core development team
- The license allows for private modifications if the above is insufficient 

## On Art Contributing: 
- Community provided art and assets are essential and integral, but at the same time fragile.
- We suspect that art assets will require separate licensing agreements. Assets contributed directly to the repository here via pull request/discussion threads will fall under the license provided. Assets that are contributed through other mediums (Commission, Discord, Reddit, etc.) will require separate licensing agreements and cannot be added to the repository without history of these agreeemnts.
