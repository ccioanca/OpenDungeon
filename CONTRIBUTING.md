## On Contributing Rules:
- Community driven development & ideation with veto powers from the core development team
- The license allows for private modifications if the above is insufficient 

### How to Write New Rules
To keep our system modular and easy to read, we use three ways to introduce rules. When you want to add something to the game, choose the method that matches your goal from below

#### 1. Foundational Rule
If you are writing a fundamental part of the game that everyone needs, write a **Core Rule** (generally this is part of the core engine module). These should be as simple as possible.

#### 2. Additive Rule
**This is the preferred method for adding to the game.** Instead of changing an existing rule, you add a new layer to it.
- _Example:_ The Core says how to jump. Your module adds a rule for "Jumping while on fire."
- This makes it so we don't have to worry about breaking the jumping rules; we’re just adding a specific scenario on top.

#### 3. Replacement Rule
Use this only when you want to **completely delete** a Core rule and replace it with something else.
- _Example:_ Replacing "d20 Combat" with "Diceless Combat."
- There's probably more checks and balances that need to happen for replacement rules

## On Contributing Art: 
- Community provided art and assets are essential and integral, but at the same time fragile.
- We suspect that art assets will require separate licensing agreements. Assets contributed directly to the repository here via pull request/discussion threads will fall under the license provided. Assets that are contributed through other mediums (Commission, Discord, Reddit, etc.) will require separate licensing agreements and cannot be added to the repository without history of these agreeemnts.
