# Open Dungeon

## What is Open Dungeon?
Open Dungeon aims to be a completely Free, open-source, and community-driven tabletop roleplaying system that sports modularity as a driving principle. 

### What is Modularity
At it's core, Open Dungeon strives to support mixing and matching "modules" (or chunks of rules & mechanics) to build a customized ruleset built for what _you_ want to play. 

From dungeon delving high fantasy, to gritty western, to FTL space pirates, you should be able snap together the modules that fit your playstyle and setting using the same core ruleset, regardless of where it's being applied. 

## Can I Contribute? 
Of course! Anyone is welcome to contribute. As a matter of fact, since Open Dungeon is Free and open-source, you can download this repo, make any changes you want, and no one can tell you not to. 

If you would like to officially contribute to the Open Dungeon project, you can start by opening an Issue or creating a Pull Request
