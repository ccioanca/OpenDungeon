## Hierarchy 
Using an atomic-like structure, ODe0.1 intends to allow for mixing and matching different rules 
The working hierarchy looks as follows: 
1. Trait
2. Feature
3. Module
4. Engine

*Additional term vibes to consider:*
Shelf/Library > Tome > Chapter > Entry/Excerpt 
Weave/Fabric > Pattern/Brane > Thread > Fiber
## Core
The Core Module is not a series of specific rules, but rather an engine of how the rest of the game will be built.
